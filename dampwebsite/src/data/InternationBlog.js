    "intro": "I am Shashank Nyol, a fourth-year dual degree student with specialization in Structural Engineering. I was the captain of IITB Seismic Team which participated in the Seismic Design Competition 2023 held at San Francisco in the United States. This article gives an overview about my complete journey right from joining the team to leading it and about my visit abroad.",
    "My journey through the team": "I joined the team when I was in 3rd semester. I got to know about the recruitment information through email, which mentioned about the competition briefly and how the IIT Bombay won “The Spirit of the Competition Award” during its debut participation. There wasn’t a rigorous selection procedure in place, the email was just a call for enthusiastic students. I found my interests aligned right away as I was going through the email, because during that time I was looking for opportunities to explore the core field. So fairly enough, this was an opportunity knocking at my door! And in response, I didn’t hesitate to express my interest. Since, there were no formal selections, we were assigned to learn ETABS software right away through weekly meetings. As time progressed, we were assigned more mature roles of modelling the building on software and this was the point when I could make sense of some concepts which I was learning through courses. I was intrigued by the fact that, how even the basic knowledge from 1st and 2nd year courses could be utilized to handle some challenging design constraints in the building. That was the post-covid time and the competition was postponed from its usual in April to June. Consequently, we did not have a hectic workload during the semester. Until that time the modelling and analysis of building on software had been completed. The exhaustive preparations started in May, after the endsem exams. It was the time to begin construction. And before beginning construction, we had to devise the methodology, which could entertain the challenges posed due to small size of members, intricate connections and could comply to the precise quality requirements. Believe me, this was a much more difficult task to accomplish than what it seems on paper!! Those were the times when I literally used to dwell in the EM lab (a lively working place at ground floor of CED), with frequent visits to TL for fabricating members. I even have pictures of Divyansh, sleeping on the lab table :). Finally, after days of ill-scheduled sleep and hard efforts, we packed and sent off the model to USA. Nobody could go there to represent our college due to covid constraints. But gracefully, one university generously agreed to handle our model there and the management approved it. I took the responsibility of giving oral presentation about the building’s design, which was one of the judging criteria. Following it, was the shake day, and our heartbeats were at all-time high. It was a huge relief, when we saw that the model survived both shakings, leaving space only for pride. On our success, we received appreciation from the HOD and our faculty advisor.
    Now, it was the time for me to relax for some months since the autumn semester was not hectic in regard of the competition. During December, the communication regarding next edition of the competition had arrived. I decided to take the leadership role during this time. It was a tough call, against the fact that other tech teams of our institute are led by 4th year students. But I took it, with the belief that I had already landed into responsible roles during previous year, due to the absence of a proper structure in place, since the team is young and in its building up stage. For beginning the new session, we held recruitment in November. Following it, we started working on the design proposal in December, which is the first phase of the competition, and an important screening criterion before securing invitation. 
    We kickstarted the work with the beginning of Spring semester 2023, with a fun filled informal all team meet to formally welcome the new members and familiarize with each other. Me and the senior team members planned to have daily work sessions during night in the EM lab, skipping as minimum days as possible. Which, was motivated from the culture of IITB Racing Team. Alongside, we also insisted junior team members to attend those sessions on regular basis. Our first target was to prepare the damper proposal, for which we went on to build from scratch a friction damper completely by ourselves. Since, we only had a month’s time to succeed in this new venture, there were only limited tests which we could perform, those also, with the challenge of operating the shake table for the first time. Due to those reasons combined, we couldn’t obtain the desired results from the damper. This was not a setback, but a stepping stone for future teams to come and utilize the learnings from our experience. Moving forward with our preparations, we finalized the building’s design before the midsem exams. Right after midsem, we began the construction of trial model, whose purpose was to be tested on shake table to predict the response of the actual model. After having intense discussions with Mr. Khan, who was the former in charge of Heavy Structures Laboratory, and had gained immense experience by assisting many alumni for their thesis projects that involved working on shake table, we began the preparations for testing. Soon, the day of testing had arrived, something of the sort never experienced by any of us before, and so all the phone cameras were focusing on the model to ensure that no angle got missed. After the first test went as per our expectations, we continued for multiple tests further. Thereafter, we had all the conclusions made out from testing results handy, and after brainstorming on a few required structural modifications to the final design, one of which came surprisingly from Prof RS Jangid during his visit to the lab, we built the final structure. I could feel the recap of previous year, where many of us cut short our sleeps during the construction of the final model, addressing many challenges and failures which had come on our way, where we had to repeat the same process for hours. This time it was even more intense. The reason being that, it was the first week of April and I had to complete my study for endsem a priori to departing for USA, since I was to return after my first exam. After shipping the model, it was me and Divyansh, who were filled with unbridled enthusiasm to fly off to the opposite part of the world!!
